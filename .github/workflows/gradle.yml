    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Using a Linux runner

    # Steps in the job
    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout your repository code
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Set up Java Development Kit (JDK)
    # Fabric mods for Minecraft 1.21.4 require Java 17
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin' # Recommended distribution for GitHub Actions
        cache: 'gradle' # Caches Gradle dependencies to speed up builds

    # Step 3: Make gradlew executable (important for Linux runners)
    - name: Make gradlew executable
      run: chmod +x ./gradlew

    # Step 4: Run the Gradle build command
    - name: Build with Gradle
      run: ./gradlew build

    # Optional Step 5: Upload the built mod JAR as an artifact
    # This makes the compiled .jar file easily downloadable from the GitHub Actions run
    - name: Upload artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: TrajectoryMod-jar
        path: build/libs/*.jar # Adjust this path if your JAR name/location is different
        # You might want to exclude -dev.jar or -sources.jar if they are generated
        # For example: path: build/libs/*-@(dev|sources).jar
